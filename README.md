# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling when dealing with user input.  Specifically, the example code attempts to parse a user ID as an integer but doesn't handle cases where the ID is not a valid number. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling. The solution includes checks for invalid input types and returns appropriate HTTP status codes.
